# 🛠 QuickFix - Complaint Management System

Say goodbye to paper forms, long queues, and miscommunication! The **Complaint Management System** is a smart digital solution that transforms the traditional, time-consuming complaint handling process into a fast, transparent, and automated workflow.

Instead of physically visiting departments or waiting days for updates, students and faculty can now submit complaints online. These complaints are instantly emailed to the respective departments. With a single click from their inbox, department staff can update the status—automatically syncing it to the admin dashboard and notifying the user via email. A built-in **timer system** ensures accountability: if a complaint isn’t resolved within 2–3 days, an **automatic escalation email is sent to higher authorities** for prompt intervention. It's efficient, trackable, and built to save time for everyone involved.
